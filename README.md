## Project Description

This project studies how the investment in real estate evolve over time at a narrow geographic level within China. Since the 21st century, China had developed in jet speed. Regardless of the house pricing in the original first-tier cities, e.g. Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, less-developed cities like Chengdu, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Xiâ€™an actually had the biggest price gain in the House price in recent years. Real estate investment had been pushed to the spotlight, and purchasing house property has been regarded as one of the biggest challenging problems for the younger generations.
