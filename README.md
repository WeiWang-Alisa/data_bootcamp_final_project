# data_bootcamp_final_project
Final project for Data Bootcamp 2019.

This project was completed by Wei Wang and Ruijie(Cherry) Cai in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, spring 2019. I certify that NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowleged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.
